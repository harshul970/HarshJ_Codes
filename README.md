Python Task:
For Python task please use WebSearchCode.py file.
As mentioned in the question, we can use one or two arguments for this file.
E.g. If we will use "python WebSearchCode.py 'Search Keyword'" command then it will return the result and if we will use "python WebSearchCode.py 'Search Keyword' 'Page Number'" command then it will return result of page no. mentioned in the second argument.

I have used BeautifulSoup library for pulling HTML data. I have also uploaded the beautifulsoup4-4.4.0.tar.gz file as well.


Hash Task:
For Reverse Hash problem please use ReverseHashCode.py file. This code have a function "HashFunction()" which will take input from "HashString" and will return the String.
